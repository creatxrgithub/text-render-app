first try with vuejs

this project is aim to render chinese text.
e.g. writing vertically, convert to trandition chinese.
and other's style like font family, background, color, gradient ...

so that to take a screenshot for interesting publish.

anyway, it's useful for me even if it's a learning project or demo of vuejs.

**I think I've realized why React feels so primitive and Vue feels so good.**
